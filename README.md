💫 About Me
👋 Hey there! I’m Nagulantharan, a highly motivated Full-Stack MERN Developer from Coimbatore, India, with a strong passion for building scalable web applications and solving complex problems through code.

I bring ideas to life using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and thrive in dynamic environments where learning never stops. Whether it's front-end interfaces or back-end APIs, I enjoy crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. I’m also deeply interested in exploring the intersection of software engineering with DevOps and Data Structures & Algorithms, where performance and scalability meet thoughtful design.
